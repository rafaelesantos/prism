/// An observable store that holds application state and processes actions through reducers and middleware.
///
/// `PrismStore` is the central hub of the Prism architecture. It owns the current state,
/// applies actions via a reducer, executes asynchronous effects, and supports scoping
/// to derive child stores for sub-features.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppState: Sendable, Equatable {
///     var count = 0
/// }
///
/// enum AppAction: Sendable {
///     case increment
///     case decrement
/// }
///
/// let store = PrismStore(
///     initialState: AppState(),
///     reduce: { state, action in
///         switch action {
///         case .increment: state.count += 1
///         case .decrement: state.count -= 1
///         }
///         return .none
///     }
