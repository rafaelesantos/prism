# Prism

Prism is a modern Swift package for building Apple apps with a shared foundation layer, networking primitives, architecture building blocks, adaptive UI components, media helpers, and intelligence experiments.

## Vision

- Ship one professional core library that can support multiple Apple apps.
- Prefer modern Swift, modern SDKs, and explicit module boundaries.
- Keep the design system adaptive across iOS, macOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, and watchOS.
- Make quality gates first-class so the package can scale commercially.

## Requirements

- Swift 6.3
- Xcode 26.4 or newer
- Apple platform minimums:
  - iOS 26
  - macOS 26
  - Mac Catalyst 26
  - tvOS 26
  - watchOS 26

The current deployment targets intentionally follow the latest SDK generation because `PrismUI` already adopts newer SwiftUI capabilities such as `glassEffect`.

## Public Products

- `Prism`: umbrella module that re-exports the core Prism modules for app-level convenience.
- `PrismFoundation`: shared defaults, resources, formatting, logging, locale helpers, and lightweight entities.
- `PrismNetwork`: HTTP/socket infrastructure, endpoints, caching, logging, and FIX transport support.
- `PrismArchitecture`: router, store, reducer, and middleware primitives.
- `PrismUI`: theme system, atoms, molecules, modifiers, accessibility helpers, and app-facing SwiftUI components.
- `PrismVideo`: video download helpers and media-related entities.
- `PrismIntelligence`: local training and prediction with CreateML/CoreML plus Apple Intelligence and remote language model providers.

The recommended entry point for app-side consumption is `PrismIntelligenceClient`, which offers one simple facade across local, Apple Intelligence, and remote model backends.

## Naming Protocol: The Celestial Standard

This document defines the naming hierarchy for the ecosystem, ensuring a premium, cohesive, and scalable identity across all future developments.

### The Core: **AXIS**
**AXIS** is the foundational Library. It acts as the central point of rotation for all technology.
* **Modules:** Intelligence, UI, Network, Architecture.
* **Code Standard:** Prefix internal components with the core name (e.g., `AxisUI`, `AxisNet`).

| Sector | Codename | Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation (Core)** | **AXIS** | The central line connecting all points. |
| **Investments** | **ZENITH** | The highest point; peak financial performance. |
| **Health** | **VITAL** | Essential for life; core biometrics. |
| **Commerce** | **ORBIT** | Continuous flow of goods and transactions. |
| **Consultancy** | **BEACON** | A guiding light; strategic direction. |


```text
                     [ AXIS ]
                 (The Core Lib)
                       |
      _________________|_________________
     |         |             |           |
 [ ZENITH ] [ VITAL ]    [ ORBIT ]   [ BEACON ]
 (Finance)  (Health)    (Commerce)  (Advisory)
     |         |             |           |
  [ YIELD ] [ AURA ]      [ FLOW ]    [ STRATUM ]
```

1.  **Abstract, Not Literal:** Use concepts (e.g., `ORBIT`), never descriptions (e.g., `ShopApp`).
2.  **Brevity:** Maximum 2 syllables for clarity and impact.
3.  **Premium Feel:** Select nouns that evoke stability, future, or space.
4.  **Implementation:** Use the codename for app-specific modules (e.g., `ZenithEngine`, `VitalAuth`).

## Adaptive UI Strategy

PrismUI is being structured as a latest-SDK-first design system:

- Shared tokens for color, spacing, radius, and size.
- SwiftUI-first APIs that can adapt to touch, pointer, focus, and remote-based interaction models.
- Platform-aware wrappers for UIKit/AppKit differences when behavior diverges.
- Explicit compatibility decisions instead of pretending every component behaves the same on every Apple OS.

The next evolution of `PrismUI` should continue in this direction: one visual language, native interaction patterns per platform.

## Quality Gates

The repository now has a standard quality workflow:

- `swift format` as the official formatter and style linter.
- Explicit target dependency import checks in `swift build` and `swift test`.
- Automated validation scripts in `scripts/`.
- GitHub Actions CI for lint, build, and test.
- Changelog, contribution, and security documentation for maintainability.

## Installation

Add the package with your repository URL:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "<repository-url>", branch: "main")
]
```

Then depend on the product you need:

```swift
.product(name: "Prism", package: "prism")
```

You can import the umbrella module:

```swift
import Prism
```

Or only the focused modules you want:

```swift
import PrismFoundation
import PrismUI
```

## Development

Prism ships with a small command surface for day-to-day development:

```bash
make format
make lint
make build
make test
make validate
```

Those commands wrap the scripts in `scripts/` so the same checks run locally and in CI.



## Commercial Readiness Checklist

- Modular public products with explicit module boundaries
- Modern Swift 6.3 toolchain with strict concurrency (`Sendable`, `@MainActor`, actor isolation)
- Automated format/lint/build/test workflow with code coverage
- 134 tests across 29 suites covering all 6 modules
- DocC documentation on all public declarations (~516 symbols)
- Thread-safety documentation on all `@unchecked Sendable` types
- MIT license
- Changelog, contribution, and security documentation

Still recommended before calling the package production-ready:

- Validate the Apple platform matrix in dedicated Xcode builds
- Add snapshot or ViewInspector tests for PrismUI visual components
- Tag v1.0.0 once the public API surface stabilizes
